Pre-install: set a PREFIX
----------------------------
for Solaris:
export PREFIX=/export/home/apache-2.0.xx (where xx is the version you are
compiling)

for Linux:
export PREFIX=/usr/local/apache-2.0.xx (where xx is the version you are
compiling)

If you have any existing symlinks in place for your existing Apache install,
best remove them or they may get stomped.

MM (http://www.engelschall.com/sw/mm/#tarballs)
-----------------------------------------------
./configure --prefix=$PREFIX
#./configure (problems with apache finding libmm in the apache runtime tree?)
make
sudo make install

OpenSSL 0.9.7x (http://www.openssl.org/source/)
-----------------------------------------------
./config --prefix=$PREFIX shared

The 'shared' statement will make OpenSSL build shared libraries.  You want
this (see e-mail thread at the bottom of this file).

make
sudo make install

Apache 2.0.xx
-------------
unpack the tarball, cd into the source directory.  To get a full listing of
compile options you can set in Apache, use './configure --help'

Before you compile the main httpd binary with LDAP support, you'll need to
first compile the 'apr-util' with LDAP support as well:

cd $APACHE_SRC/srclib/apr-util
./configure --with-ldap --with-dbm=gdbm --with-apr=../apr
make

Then compile Apache:

./configure \
--prefix=$PREFIX \
--with-ssl=$PREFIX \
--enable-auth-dbm \
--enable-auth-digest \
--enable-dav \
--enable-dav-fs \
--enable-info \
--enable-rewrite \
--enable-proxy \
--enable-ssl \
--enable-usertrack \
--enable-vhost-alias \
--enable-static-htpasswd \
--enable-static-ab \
--enable-mods-shared=all \
--with-mpm=prefork

make
sudo make install

Change the User and Group in httpd.conf that the webserver will run as to the
user/group you created at the top of this file.

# --enable-example \ # for development only
# --enable-so \ # enabled when --enable-shared-mods is used as well
# --enable-ldap=/usr \ # having problems compiling ldap
# --enable-auth-ldap \ # having problems compiling ldap

For Apache 2.0.47 on Solaris, if you compile using GCC, some of the Apache
modules don't get linked correctly against libgcc.a.  This is because the
Apache coders use the GNU ld utility for linking modules, which doesn't come by
default on the reference system.  You can either link the culprit files by
hand, or install the GNU binutils and recompile.  See the below URL's for more
info and solutions:

http://perl.apache.org/docs/1.0/guide/troubleshooting.html#symbol___floatdisf__referenced_symbol_not_found
http://www.riverside.org/archive/html/new-httpd/2003-01/msg00051.html

For mod_ssl, chances are Apache won't link to the correct archived library
(libssl.a), and you'll have to re-link the file to create a new shared library.
(maybe go back in and rebuild the mod_ssl library with all of the lo files in
the ssl directory)

See also the OpenSSL thread at the bottom of this file.

IMAP 2004 (ftp://ftp.cac.washington.edu/imap/)
-----------------------------------------------
Unpack the IMAP tarball, then edit "src/osdep/unix/Makefile".  At the top of
that file, there are a bunch of SSL-related compile directives.  Change those
directives so that they match your SSL installation;
SSLDIR=/usr/local/apache2
SSLCERTS=$(SSLDIR)/ssl/certs
SSLKEYS=$(SSLCERTS)
SSLINCLUDE=$(SSLDIR)/include
SSLLIB=$(SSLDIR)/lib

then compile IMAP with:

make slx

PostgreSQL 7.3.x (http://www.postgresql.org/mirrors-ftp.html)
----------------
PostgreSQL REQUIRES GNU make.  If you don't have it, you'll need to go get it
from Sunfreeware.com.  Also, you may need to reset some of the kernel's memory
parameters.  <http://postgresql.readysetnet.com/devel-corner/docs/admin/kernel-r
esources.html#SYSVIPC> will give you more dirt.

./configure --prefix=/export/home/postgres --with-openssl=/usr/local/ssl \
--with-includes=/usr/local/includes 

make
make install

adduser postgres (add the user to the system)
chown postgres /export/home/postgres/data
su - postgres
/export/home/postgres/bin/initdb -D /export/home/postgres/data

MySQL 3.23.xx (http://www.mysql.com/downloads/)
-----------------------------------------------
Use the following lines to configure/compile MySQL:

CC=gcc CFLAGS="-O3 -fno-omit-frame-pointer -mcpu=v8 -Wa,-xarch=v8plusa" \
CXX=gcc \ 
CXXFLAGS="-O3 -fno-omit-frame-pointer -felide-constructors -fno-exceptions \
-fno-rtti -mcpu=v8 -Wa,-xarch=v8plusa" \
./configure --prefix=/export/home/mysql \
--with-extra-charsets=complex --enable-thread-safe-client\
--enable-local-infile --enable-assembler --with-named-z-libs=no\
--with-named-curses-libs=-lcurses --disable-shared 

make
make install

The basic commands you must execute to install and use a MySQL binary
distribution are:

     shell> cd /usr/local
     shell> gunzip < /path/to/mysql-VERSION-OS.tar.gz | tar xvf -
     shell> ln -s full-path-to-mysql-VERSION-OS mysql
     shell> cd mysql
     shell> scripts/mysql_install_db
     shell> chown -R root  .
     shell> chown -R mysql data
     shell> chgrp -R mysql .
     shell> bin/mysqld_safe --user=mysql &
     or
     shell> bin/mysqld_safe --user=mysql &
     if you are running MySQL 4.x


PHP 4.3.x (http://www.php.net/download)
---------------------------------------

# need oracle client package
# need zlib headers
# need gdbm headers
# need postresql-dev package, which has header files

./configure --prefix=$PREFIX \
--with-apxs2=$PREFIX/bin/apxs \
--with-config-file-path=$PREFIX/conf \
--with-mysql \
--with-pgsql \

--enable-track-var \

sudo make install

OpenSSL Shared Libraries
------------------------
For Solaris, you'll need to build OpenSSL as shared libraries instead of static
libraries.  From the message:

http://www.mail-archive.com/modssl-users@modssl.org/msg15745.html

I'm CC:'ing this to the modssl-users list, since I'm sure somebody else
out there probably has the same question.

It's kind of annoying, because the shared library support in OpenSSL is
"experimental", which in practice just means that the Makefile is
non-intuitive.  I just ran through it again to make sure I got all the
steps right... here's what you do.

I'm going to assume that you have the static version of OpenSSL installed
in /usr/local/lib in this example... just fix the path to match where
OpenSSL gets installed on your machine.

So let's say you've installed OpenSSL previously, but it's the static
version, so you have /usr/local/lib/libssl.a and
/usr/local/lib/libcrypto.a .  Remove those.

Go back to the OpenSSL source directory and do the following:

./config
make
make build-shared
mv libssl.so* /usr/local/lib
mv libcrypto.so* /usr/local/lib
ldconfig

(note: do NOT run make install, or it will remove all your shared
libraries and install the static ones, and you'll have to start over
again.  :-)

That ought to do it.  I recommend doing a search on your filesystem for
other, older copies of libssl* and libcrypto* that might be hanging
around, as sometimes copies get put in strange places and you want to be
sure to only have one: the most recent.
