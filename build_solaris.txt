Building Apache, by Brian Manning - Last updated May 21st, 2001
---------------------------------------------------------------
Following is a listing of build steps for each part of Apache.  Anything past
Apache is optional.  This setup will get you enough stuff to run most webmail
clients out there, like TWIG (http://twig.screwdriver.net/) or IMP/HORDE
(http://www.horde.org).  Read the whole document first to get a better idea of
what's presented here, as there's comments all throughout the file.

Preliminary
-----------
Download all the below listed packages that you want to use.  Place them all in
one directory, and unzip them.  This will be referred to the 'build' directory.
Inside the build directory, make symlinks to the directories containing the
source, as the source packages will be referred in these instructions by the
name of the directory without any version information.  For example, make a
symlink from 'apache-1.3.x' to 'apache' in the source directory.  The
destination of all the software will be the name of the Apache version; if you
are installing Apache 1.3.23 to /export/home, then the full path will be
/export/home/apache-1.3.23, and a symlink will be made from the install
directory to /export/home/apache.  Applications that are installed inside the
Apache tree will also use their full versions into the installation
directories, with symlink shortcuts.

Set up the install environment
------------------------------
For the bash shell users:
export PREFIX=/export/home/apps/apache-1.3.23

OpenSSL (http://www.openssl.org/source/)
----------------------------------------
./config --prefix=$PREFIX
make
sudo make install

# Note, the Solaris 8 refsystem here already has Openssl installed in
# /usr/local/openssl.  Overwrite it at your peril.

MM (http://www.engelschall.com/sw/mm/#tarballs)
-----------------------------------------------
./configure --prefix=$PREFIX
make
sudo make install

mod_ssl (http://www.modssl.org/source/)
---------------------------------------
./configure \
--with-apache=/export/home/files/build/apache_1.3.23 \
--with-ssl=/export/home/apps/apache-1.3.23 \
--enable-shared=ssl

Upgrades to mod_ssl
-------------------
./configure \
--with-apxs=/export/home/apache \
--with-ssl=/usr/local \
--with-mm=/usr/local

make
sudo make install
make distclean

Apache (http://httpd.apache.org/dist/httpd/)
--------------------------------------------
LIBS=-lpthread \
SSL_BASE=$PREFIX \
EAPI_MM=/export/home/files/build/mm-1.1.3 \
./configure \
--prefix=$PREFIX \
--enable-module=ssl \
--enable-module=most \
--enable-shared=max \
--enable-rule=EAPI \
--enable-rule=SHARED_CORE \
--enable-rule=SHARED_CHAIN \
--enable-module=so

make
make certificate TYPE=custom
sudo make install

Frontpage extensions (http://www.rtr.com/fpsupport/download.htm)
----------------------------------------------------------------
Download the Frontpage extensions from RTR.  You can also as an option download
the Apache module 'mod_frontpage', which provides a suEXEC wrapper to
Frontpage.  If you do decide to use mod_frontpage, you will be patching Apache
with the source from that instead of the source that comes with the RTR
Frontpage package.  BE SURE to make a copy of the 'httpd' binary before you
start, as Frontpage will be replacing it before it's done installing.  The
'httpd' binary lives in '/export/home/apache/bin/httpd'.  You will also need a
'.htaccess' file in the same directory as where you set up the root web. 

Edit the httpd.conf file, and change the following:

AllowOverride All
DocumentRoot /export/home/webuser/www
Port 80
Listen 80
Listen 443
User www
Group webuser
cgi-bin should be /export/home/webuser/cgi-bin

This is so when you run the FrontPage installer, it will install, as it's
scripting is brain-dead.  During the install process, you will be replacing
your Apache binary with the FrontPage provided binary; this is only temporary,
as you will be compiling an Apache binary from scratch with FrontPage as an
Apache module.

Un-gzip or uncompress the Frontpage package before you begin.

uncompress fp50.solaris.tar.Z

Then untar it to get the fp_install.sh script out:

tar xvf fp50.solaris.tar

Copy the install shell script somewhere:

cp fp_install.sh /tmp

Then retar the Frontpage tarball:

tar cvf fp50.solaris.tar frontpage

#Go into the bin directory, and run:

#./owsadm.exe -o install -u webuser -p 80 -servconf
#/export/home/apache/conf/httpd.conf -xuser webuser -xgroup webuser

#This will add the files for the root web, and correctly set ownership of the
#files.

#(Note: FP installer choked on setting up in DocumentRoot, as mine are in
#virtual hosts, not in the main part of the config file.)

Copy the file 'fp-patch-apache_1.3.19' to the $APACHE/src directory.  Solaris 8
comes with GNU patch, it's called 'gpatch'.  Solaris patch won't figure out the
RTR Apache patch.  Recompile Apache, but add a '--add-module=mod_frontpage.c'
and to the ./configure line.

Compiled-in mod_frontpage ./configure line:
SSL_BASE=/export/home/openssl EAPI_MM=/export/home/build/mm-1.1.3 ./configure \
--prefix=/export/home/apache --enable-module=ssl --enable-module=most \
--enable-shared=max --enable-rule=EAPI --enable-rule=SHARED_CORE \
--enable-rule=SHARED_CHAIN --add-module=mod_frontpage.c --enable-module=so

Shared module mod_frontpage:
SSL_BASE=/export/home/openssl EAPI_MM=/export/home/build/mm-1.1.3 ./configure \
--prefix=/export/home/apache --enable-module=ssl --enable-module=most \
--enable-shared=max --enable-rule=EAPI --enable-rule=SHARED_CORE \
--enable-rule=SHARED_CHAIN --activate-module=src/modules/mod_frontpage.o \
--enable-shared=frontpage --enable-module=so

MySQL (http://www.mysql.com/downloads/)
-----
./configure --mandir=$PREFIX/man --prefix=$PREFIX/mysql-version.number \
--enable-assembler --with-mysqld-user=mysql 
# then:

make 
make test
make install

# Change the perms in the mysql directory:

chown -R root /export/home/mysql
chown -R mysql /export/home/mysql/var
chgrp -R mysql /export/home/mysql

# cd to your installed directory, in this case /export/home/mysql, then run
./bin/mysql_install_db

# this sets up MySQL's auth system.

# Log into mysql by using /export/home/mysql/bin/mysql, and enter the following:

mysql> set password for root@localhost = password('password');

-and-

mysql> set password for root@host.com = password('password');
 
Copy the file 'mysql.server' to /etc/init.d as 'mysql', and make a symlink back
from /etc/rc3.d to the file in /etc/init.d.  Also, to make the daemon run as
user 'mysql', you'll need to add '--user=mysql' to the start) line in
/etc/init.d/mysql.

PostgreSQL (http://postgresql.readysetnet.com/sites.html) [mirror]
----------
PostgreSQL REQUIRES GNU make.  If you don't have it, you'll need to go get it
from Sunfreeware.com.  Also, you may need to reset some of the kernel's memory
parameters.  <http://postgresql.readysetnet.com/devel-corner/docs/admin/kernel-resources.html#SYSVIPC> will give you more dirt.

adduser postgres (add the user to the system)
su - postgres

./configure --prefix=$PREFIX/postgres-7.1.3 --mandir=$PREFIX/man \
--with-openssl=$PREFIX/ssl --with-includes=$PREFIX/include --enable-syslog
make
make install

# initialize the data directory
/export/home/apps/apache/postgres/bin/initdb \
-D /export/home/apps/apache/postgres/data

# this will start the database with logging going to 'logfile'
# use pg_ctl to start postgres from init scripts
/export/home/apps/apache/postgres/bin/postmaster \
-D /export/home/apps/apache/postgres/data >logfile 2>&1 &

# create the test database
/export/home/apache/apps/postgres/bin/createdb test

# then open it up with the 'psql' command line client
/export/home/apps/apache/postgres/bin/psql test

If you want to run the regression tests, you can do so by going to the source
directory and running 'make check' as the user 'postgres'.  Building postgres
as the user 'postgres' is recommended if you plan to run the regression tests.
If you build as root, then run the regression tests as 'postgres', the test
won't be able to write over the files owned by root.

I've created a PostgreSQL start/stop script that should come in handy, it's
called 'postgres', and it should either live in the same CVS repository as this
one, or in a repository called 'scripts'.  It will kill a database in both
normal and immediate modes.


PHP (http://www.php.net/downloads.php)
(See below for more details about this specific build as well as other software
dependencies that PHP requires before it will build)
--------
./configure \
--prefix=$PREFIX \
--with-apxs=$PREFIX/bin/apxs \
--with-config-file-path=$PREFIX/conf \
--with-gd \
--with-mysql=$PREFIX/mysql \
--with-pgsql=$PREFIX/postgres \
--with-oci8=/export/home/oracle-9.0.1/OraHome1 \
--with-mm=/usr/local/lib \
--with-zlib=/lib \
--with-xml \
--with-openssl=$PREFIX \
--with-gdbm \
--with-gettext \
--enable--sysvsem \
--enable-sysvshm \
--enable-force-cgi-redirect \
--enable-calendar \
--enable-inline-optimization \
--enable-trans-sid \
--enable-track-vars

make
make install

cp php.ini-dist /export/home/apache/conf/php.ini

Add the following directives to Apache's httpd.conf file:
	AddType application/x-httpd-php .php
	AddType application/x-httpd-php .php3
	AddType application/x-httpd-php3-source .phps

And add the following types to the DirectoryIndex direcive:
	index.php index.php3

I don't think you need to use '--with-apache[=DIR]' if you do
'--with-apxs[=FILE]' instead.

Left over config variables
#--with-imap=/usr/local/src/apache/imap \
#--with-ldap=/usr/lib \ 

After I built PHP, if I do configtest in Apache, it complains about not seeing
the libs for MySQL and PostgreSQL.  They're located under /export/home, so
they're not in the system's library path.  In Solaris, this is set in
/etc/profile, as LD_LIBRARY_PATH.  Copying libpq.so.?.? and
libmysqlclient.so.?.? to Apache's libexec directory fixed it's bitching, but
strangely adding the above paths did not.

mod_perl (http://perl.apache.org/)
--------
perl Makefile.PL \
USE_APXS=1 \
WITH_APXS=/usr/local/apache/bin/apxs \
EVERYTHING=1

make
make install

FastCGI (http://www.fastcgi.com)
-------
/export/home/apache/bin/apxs -o mod_fastcgi.so -c *.c
sudo /export/home/apache/bin/apxs -i -a -n fastcgi mod_fastcgi.so 
	
ModDAV (http://www.webdav.org/mod_dav/)
------
./configure --with-apxs=/usr/local/apache/bin/apxs

make
make install


================================================================
More Information
================================================================
These instructions will build everything but Apache and mod_ssl as DSO's, or in
Apache-speak, loadable modules.  Loadable modules are a good thing because if
you don't want to use the module, you can unload it.  And you can update each
module as new versions come out, that way you don't end up recompiling Apache
every time something new shows up.

Assumptions:
------------
You want to install Apache and all of it's junk in the /usr/local tree.  If
that is false, change everything below that says --prefix=/usr/local to
something you like instead.

Tips
----
1) unpack all of the tarballs into one directory. make sure that MySQL is
already installed

2) go into the individual directories, and run the configures/makes for all of
the pieces parts

3) watch those bash shell tab completions.  If it adds an extra forward slash
to the end of a directory name, you can bet it will fuck up the make scripts.

PHP
===
Assumption: you are either compiling IMAP from scratch, or are lucky enough to
have all of the dependencies that PHP is looking for.   

PHP Extra Module Requirements (Optional)
----------------------------------------
- gd graphics libs > 1.3.3 (both regular and devel packages)
(http://www.boutell.com/gd/#getgd)
	-libjpeg (http://www.ijg.org/)
	-libpng (http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/libpng.html)
	-libungif (http://prtr-13.ucsc.edu/~badger/software/libungif/index.shtml)
	-libXpm (ftp://ftp.x.org/contrib/libraries/)
    -FreeType (http://freetype.sourceforge.net/download.html#freetype2)
- UW IMAP (compile from scratch, with notes below)
- gdbm database (including development package if you are installing from
  packages)
- bison package

If you don't want to install IMAP over an extisting IMAP binary that's already
on your system, you can do the steps below:

From the IMAP source directory, copy the src/c-client/mail.h, rfc822.h,
linkage.h to /usr/local/include; copy c-client.a  to /usr/local/lib, and do a
ln -s c-client.a libc-client.a

Copy the imapd/imapd.o file from the UW IMAP to the php-3.0.x/dl/imap/,
then run dl/setup, followed by dl/make imap.so.
Heed the instructions that it spits out after you run setup

Copy the imap.so shared library to /usr/local/lib, or wherever your
library files go to...
