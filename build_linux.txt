Building Apache, by Brian Manning - Last updated May 21st, 2001
---------------------------------------------------------------
Following is a listing of build steps for each part of Apache.  Anything past
Apache is optional.  This setup will get you enough stuff to run most webmail
clients out there, like TWIG (http://twig.screwdriver.net/) or IMP/HORDE
(http://www.horde.org).  More verbose instructions are at the bottom of this
document.


OpenSSL (http://www.openssl.org/source/)
-------------
./config --prefix=/usr/local --openssldir=/usr/local
make
sudo make install

MM (http://www.engelschall.com/sw/mm/#tarballs)
--------
./configure --disable-shared
make
sudo make install

mod_ssl (http://www.modssl.org/source/)
------------------------------
./configure \
--with-apache=/usr/local/src/apache/apache_1.3.12 \
--with-ssl=/usr/local/ssl \
--enable-shared=ssl

make
sudo make install
make distclean

Apache (http://httpd.apache.org/dist/httpd/)
-------------
SSL_BASE=/usr/local \
EAPI_MM=/usr/local/src/apache/mm-1.1.3 \
./configure \
--prefix=/usr/local/apache \
--enable-module=ssl \
--enable-module=most \
--enable-shared=max \
--enable-rule=EAPI \  ( ??? Check this one )
--enable-rule=SHARED_CORE \
--enable-rule=SHARED_CHAIN \
--enable-module=so

make
make certificate TYPE=custom
sudo make install

IMAP (http://www.washington.edu/imap/)
----
make slx

Upgrade the below modules at any time using the
'apxs' binary that comes with Apache

PHP (http://www.php.net/downloads.php)
(See below for more details about this specific build as well as other software
dependencies that PHP requires before it will build)
--------
./configure \
--with-apxs=/usr/local/apache/bin/apxs \
--with-config-file-path=/usr/local/apache/conf \
--with-gd \
--with-imap=/usr/local/src/apache/imap \
--with-ldap=/usr/lib \
--with-mysql \
--with-mm=/usr/local/lib \ 
--with-zlib=/usr/lib \
--with-xml \
--enable-force-cgi-redirect \
--enable-track-vars

make
make install

cp php.ini-dist /usr/local/apache/conf/php.ini

Add the following directives to Apache's httpd.conf file:
	AddType application/x-httpd-php .php
	AddType application/x-httpd-php .php3
	AddType application/x-httpd-php3-source .phps

And add the following types to the DirectoryIndex direcive:
	index.php index.php3

mod_perl (http://perl.apache.org/)
--------
perl Makefile.PL \
USE_APXS=1 \
WITH_APXS=/usr/local/apache/bin/apxs \
EVERYTHING=1

make
make install

FastCGI (http://www.fastcgi.com)
-------
/usr/local/apache/bin/apxs -o mod_fastcgi.so -c *.c
sudo /usr/local/apache/bin/apxs -i -a -n fastcgi mod_fastcgi.so 
	
ModDAV (http://www.webdav.org/mod_dav/)
------
./configure --with-apxs=/usr/local/apache/bin/apxs

make
make install


================================================================
More Information
================================================================
These instructions will build everything but Apache and mod_ssl as DSO's, or in
Apache-speak, loadable modules.  Loadable modules are a good thing because if
you don't want to use the module, you can unload it.  And you can update each
module as new versions come out, that way you don't end up recompiling Apache
every time something new shows up.

Assumptions:
------------
You want to install Apache and all of it's junk in the /usr/local tree.  If
that is false, change everything below that says --prefix=/usr/local to
something you like instead.

Tips
----
1) unpack all of the tarballs into one directory. make sure that MySQL is
already installed

2) go into the individual directories, and run the configures/makes for all of
the pieces parts

3) watch those bash shell tab completions.  If it adds an extra forward slash
to the end of a directory name, you can bet it will fuck up the make scripts.

PHP
===
Assumption: you are either compiling IMAP from scratch, or are lucky enough to
have all of the dependencies that PHP is looking for.   

PHP Extra Module Requirements (Optional)
----------------------------------------
- gd graphics libs > 1.3.3 (both regular and devel packages)
	-libjpeg
	-libpng
	-libungif
	-libXpm
- UW IMAP (compile from scratch, with notes below)
- gdbm database (including development package if you are installing from
  packages)
- bison package

If you don't want to install IMAP over an extisting IMAP binary that's already
on your system, you can do the steps below:

From the IMAP source directory, copy the src/c-client/mail.h, rfc822.h,
linkage.h to /usr/local/include; copy c-client.a  to /usr/local/lib, and do a
ln -s c-client.a libc-client.a

Copy the imapd/imapd.o file from the UW IMAP to the php-3.0.x/dl/imap/,
then run dl/setup, followed by dl/make imap.so.
Heed the instructions that it spits out after you run setup

Copy the imap.so shared library to /usr/local/lib, or wherever your
library files go to...
