    --fixed a few typo's
---------------------------------------------------------------
Following is a listing of build steps for each part of Apache.  Anything past
Apache is optional.  This setup will get you enough stuff to run most webmail
clients out there, like TWIG (http://twig.screwdriver.net/) or IMP/HORDE
(http://www.horde.org).  More verbose instructions are at the bottom of this
document.


OpenSSL (http://www.openssl.org/source/)
----------------------------------------
./config --prefix=/usr/local --openssldir=/usr/local
make
sudo make install

MM (http://www.engelschall.com/sw/mm/#tarballs)
-----------------------------------------------
./configure
make
sudo make install

mod_ssl (http://www.modssl.org/source/)
---------------------------------------
./configure \
--with-apache=/usr/local/src/apache/apache_1.3.22 \
--with-ssl=/usr/local \
--enable-shared=ssl

Upgrades to mod_ssl
-------------------
./configure \
--with-apxs=/usr/local/apache/bin \
--with-ssl=/usr/local \
--with-mm=/usr/local

make
sudo make install
make distclean

Apache (http://httpd.apache.org/dist/httpd/)
--------------------------------------------
SSL_BASE=/usr/local \
EAPI_MM=/usr/local/src/apache/mm-1.1.3 \
./configure \
--prefix=/usr/local/apache-1.3.22 \
--enable-module=ssl \
--enable-module=most \
--enable-shared=max \
--enable-rule=EAPI \
--enable-rule=SHARED_CORE \
--enable-rule=SHARED_CHAIN \
--enable-module=so

make
make certificate TYPE=custom
sudo make install

Note: Mozilla's default character encoding type is 'en-US', which apache knows
nothing about.  So if you don't want Mozilla to come up with pages of
gobbledeygook, then you need to 'AddLanguage en-US .us' in the httpd.conf file
in Apache.  Same goes with en-UK and en-AU as well. Also you need to add
en-US as the first language in the LanguagePriority section.

Frontpage extensions (http://www.rtr.com/fpsupport/download.htm)
----------------------------------------------------------------
Download the Frontpage extensions from RTR.

Edit the httpd.conf file, and change the following:

AllowOverride All
DocumentRoot /export/home/webuser/www
Port 80
Listen 80
Listen 443
User www
Group webuser
cgi-bin should be /export/home/webuser/cgi-bin

This is so when you run the FrontPage installer, it will install, as it's
scripting is brain-dead.  During the install process, you will be replacing
your Apache binary with the FrontPage provided binary; this is only temporary,
as you will be compiling an Apache binary from scratch with FrontPage as an
Apache module.

Un-gzip or uncompress the Frontpage package before you begin.

uncompress fp50.solaris.tar.Z

Then untar it to get the fp_install.sh script out:

tar xvf fp50.solaris.tar

Copy the install shell script somewhere:

cp fp_install.sh /tmp

Then retar the Frontpage tarball:

tar cvf fp50.solaris.tar frontpage

#Go into the bin directory, and run:

#./owsadm.exe -o install -u webuser -p 80 -servconf
#/export/home/apache/conf/httpd.conf -xuser webuser -xgroup webuser

#This will add the files for the root web, and correctly set ownership of the
#files.

#(Note: FP installer choked on setting up in DocumentRoot, as mine are in
#virtual hosts, not in the main part of the config file.)

Copy the file 'fp-patch-apache_1.3.19' to the $APACHE/src directory.  Solaris 8
comes with GNU patch, it's called 'gpatch'.  Solaris patch won't figure out the
RTR Apache patch.  Recompile Apache, but add a '--add-module=mod_frontpage.c'
and to the ./configure line.

Patch command goes like:

patch -p0 < fp-patch-apache_1.3.19

Compiled-in mod_frontpage ./configure line:
SSL_BASE=/export/home/openssl EAPI_MM=/export/home/build/mm-1.1.3 ./configure \
--prefix=/export/home/apache --enable-module=ssl --enable-module=most \
--enable-shared=max --enable-rule=EAPI --enable-rule=SHARED_CORE \
--enable-rule=SHARED_CHAIN --add-module=mod_frontpage.c --enable-module=so

Shared module mod_frontpage:
SSL_BASE=/export/home/openssl EAPI_MM=/export/home/build/mm-1.1.3 ./configure \
--prefix=/export/home/apache --enable-module=ssl --enable-module=most \
--enable-shared=max --enable-rule=EAPI --enable-rule=SHARED_CORE \
--enable-rule=SHARED_CHAIN --activate-module=src/modules/mod_frontpage.o \
--enable-shared=frontpage --enable-module=so


IMAP (http://www.washington.edu/imap/)
----
make slx

MySQL (http://www.mysql.com/downloads/)
-----
The compile flags below are optional, but taken from the MySQL page at:
<http://www.mysql.com/documentation/mysql/bychapter/manual_Installing.html#configure_options>

CC=gcc CFLAGS="-O3" \
CXX=gcc CXXFLAGS="-O3 -felide-constructors -fno-exceptions -fno-rtti" \
./configure --prefix=/usr/local/mysql --with-low-memory --enable-assembler

If you have a ultra sparc, you can get 4 % more performance by adding "-mcpu=v8
-Wa,-xarch=v8plusa" to CFLAGS and CXXFLAGS. 

# So my ./configure is:

[logan5][root /export/home/build/mysql-3.23.38]$ CC=gcc CFLAGS="-O3 -mcpu=v8" \
CXX=gcc CXXFLAGS="-O3 -felide-constructors -fno-exceptions -fno-rtti -mcpu=v8" \
./configure --prefix=/export/home/mysql --with-low-memory --enable-assembler

# then:

make 
make test
make install

# Change the perms in the mysql directory:

chown -R root /export/home/mysql
chown -R mysql /export/home/mysql/var
chgrp -R mysql /export/home/mysql

# cd to your installed directory, in this case /export/home/mysql, then run
./bin/mysql_install_db

# this sets up MySQL's auth system.

# Log into mysql by using /export/home/mysql/bin/mysql, and enter the following:

mysql> set password for root@localhost = password('password');

-and-

mysql> set password for root@host.com = password('password');
 
 Copy the file 'mysql.server' to /etc/init.d as 'mysql', and make a symlink back
 from /etc/rc3.d to the file in /etc/init.d.  Also, to make the daemon run as
 user 'mysql', you'll need to add '--user=mysql' to the start) line in
 /etc/init.d/mysql.

 PostgreSQL (http://postgresql.readysetnet.com/sites.html) [mirror]
 ----------
 PostgreSQL REQUIRES GNU make.  Also, you may need to reset some of the kernel's memory parameters.  
 <http://postgresql.readysetnet.com/devel-corner/docs/admin/kernel-resources.html#SYSVIPC> will give you more dirt.

 adduser postgres (add the user to the system)
 su - postgres

 ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/pgsql \
 --with-openssl=/usr/local/ --enable-syslog
 make
 make install

 # initialize the data directory
 /usr/local/pgsql/bin/initdb -D /usr/local/pgsql/data

 # this will start the database with logging going to 'logfile'
 # use pg_ctl to start postgres from init scripts
 /usr/local/pgsql/bin/postmaster \
 -D /usr/local/pgsql/data >logfile 2>&1 &

 # create the test database
 /usr/local/pgsql/bin/createdb test

 # then open it up with the 'psql' command line client
 /usr/local/pgsql/bin/psql test

 If you want to run the regression tests, you can do so by going to the source
 directory and running 'make check' as the user 'postgres'.  Building postgres
 as the user 'postgres' is recommended if you plan to run the regression tests.
 If you build as root, then run the regression tests as 'postgres', the test
 won't be able to write over the files owned by root.

 I've created a PostgreSQL start/stop script that should come in handy, it's
 called 'postgres', and it should either live in the same CVS repository as this
 one, or in a repository called 'scripts'.  It will kill a database in both
 normal and immediate modes.

 To run Postgres in SSL mode, you'll need to put a 'server.key' and 'server.crt'
 in $PGSQL/data.  Otherwise, when you go to start the server, it won't start.


 PHP (http://www.php.net/downloads.php)
 See below for more details about this specific build as well as other software
 dependencies that PHP requires before it will build.  If you are building IMAP,
 you just have to 'make' the source, you don't have to install it, PHP pulls
 what it needs out of the source.

make
make install

cp php.ini-dist /export/home/apache/conf/php.ini

Add the following directives to Apache's httpd.conf file:
AddType application/x-httpd-php .php
AddType application/x-httpd-php .php3
AddType application/x-httpd-php3-source .phps

And add the following types to the DirectoryIndex direcive:
index.php index.php3

I don't think you need to use '--with-apache[=DIR]' if you do
'--with-apxs[=FILE]' instead.

Left over config variables

#--with-ldap=/usr/lib \ 

After I built PHP, if I do configtest in Apache, it complains about not seeing
the libs for MySQL and PostgreSQL.  They're located under /export/home, so
they're not in the system's library path.  In Solaris, this is set in
/etc/profile, as LD_LIBRARY_PATH.  Copying libpq.so.?.? and
libmysqlclient.so.?.? to Apache's libexec directory fixed it's bitching, but
strangely adding the above paths did not.

mod_perl (http://perl.apache.org/)

FastCGI (http://www.fastcgi.com)
-------
/export/home/apache/bin/apxs -o mod_fastcgi.so -c *.c
sudo /export/home/apache/bin/apxs -i -a -n fastcgi mod_fastcgi.so 
			
ModDAV (http://www.webdav.org/mod_dav/)

make
make install


===============================================================
More Information
================================================================
These instructions will build everything but Apache and mod_ssl as DSO's, or in
Apache-speak, loadable modules.  Loadable modules are a good thing because if
you don't want to use the module, you can unload it.  And you can update each
module as new versions come out, that way you don't end up recompiling Apache
every time something new shows up.

Assumptions:
------------
You want to install Apache and all of it's junk in the /usr/local tree.  If
that is false, change everything below that says --prefix=/usr/local to
something you like instead.

Tips
----
1) unpack all of the tarballs into one directory. make sure that MySQL is
already installed

2) go into the individual directories, and run the configures/makes for all of
the pieces parts

3) watch those bash shell tab completions.  If it adds an extra forward slash
to the end of a directory name, you can bet it will fuck up the make scripts.

PHP
===
Assumption: you are either compiling IMAP from scratch, or are lucky enough to
have all of the dependencies that PHP is looking for.   

PHP Extra Module Requirements (Optional)
----------------------------------------
- gd graphics libs > 1.3.3 (both regular and devel packages)
(http://www.boutell.com/gd/#getgd)
-libjpeg (http://www.ijg.org/)
-libpng (http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/libpng.html)
-libungif (http://prtr-13.ucsc.edu/~badger/software/libungif/index.shtml)
-libXpm (ftp://ftp.x.org/contrib/libraries/)
- FreeType (http://freetype.sourceforge.net/download.html#freetype2)
- UW IMAP (compile from scratch, with notes below)
- gdbm database (including development package if you are installing from
  packages)
- bison package
- Ming Library (http://www.opaque.net/ming) Current version 0.2a
- PDF Library (http://www.pdflib.com) Current version 4.0.1

If you don't want to install IMAP over an extisting IMAP binary that's already
on your system, you can do the steps below:

>From the IMAP source directory, copy the src/c-client/mail.h, rfc822.h,
linkage.h to /usr/local/include; copy c-client.a  to /usr/local/lib, and do a
ln -s c-client.a libc-client.a

Copy the imapd/imapd.o file from the UW IMAP to the php-3.0.x/dl/imap/,
then run dl/setup, followed by dl/make imap.so.
Heed the instructions that it spits out after you run setup

Copy the imap.so shared library to /usr/local/lib, or wherever your
library files go to...

Another good idea for PHP is to use a ramdisk to store session ID info, this
will remove the system drives from the equasion, and should really speed things
up.

Adding the new user/group for Apache to run as
==============================================
[observer][root /usr/local/apache-1.3.22/conf]$ addgroup --gid 65533 httpd
Adding group httpd (65533)...
Done.
[observer][root /usr/local/apache-1.3.22/conf]$ adduser --no-create-home --gid
65533 --uid 65533 --disabled-password httpd
Adding user httpd...
Adding new user httpd (65533) with group httpd.
Home directory /home/httpd already exists.  Not copying from /etc/skel
Changing the user information for httpd
Enter the new value, or press return for the default
Full Name []: Apache Runtime User
Room Number []: 
Work Phone []: 
Home Phone []: 
Other []: 
Is the information correct? [y/n] y


Generating SSL certificates
 ===========================
For the initial SSL cert generation, you can use 'make certificate type=CUSTOM'
inside of Apache.  This will generate both the custom Certificate Authority
(CA) certificate (ca.crt) , and the server's certificate (server.crt).  Once
you have a CA certificate, you can sign more certificates.  There's a shell
script inside of mod_ssl called 'sign.sh' that will do the work for you.
Here's how you use it:

# Create a RSA private key for your Apache server (will be Triple-DES
# encrypted and PEM formatted):

$ openssl genrsa -des3 -out server.key 1024

# You can see the details of this RSA private key via the command:

$ openssl rsa -noout -text -in server.key

# And you could create a decrypted PEM version (not recommended) of this RSA
# private key via:

$ openssl rsa -in server.key -out server.key.unsecure

# Create a Certificate Signing Request (CSR) with the server RSA private key
# (output will be PEM formatted):

$ openssl req -new -key server.key -out server.csr

# You can see the details of this CSR via the command

$ openssl req -noout -text -in server.csr

# sign the CSR with sign.sh

$ sign.sh server.csr

# View the signed certificate

openssl x509 -noout -text -in server.crt

Creating a CA certificate
=========================
# Create a RSA private key for your CA (will be Triple-DES encrypted and
# PEM formatted):

$ openssl genrsa -des3 -out ca.key 1024

# You can see the details of this RSA private key via the command

$ openssl rsa -noout -text -in ca.key

# And you can create a decrypted PEM version (not recommended) of this private
# key via:

$ openssl rsa -in ca.key -out ca.key.unsecure

# Create a self-signed CA Certificate (X509 structure) with the RSA key of the 
# CA (output will be PEM formatted):

$ openssl req -new -x509 -days 365 -key ca.key -out ca.crt
